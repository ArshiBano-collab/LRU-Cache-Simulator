# LRU Cache Simulator

A C++ implementation of an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache using STL.

## Features
- O(1) time complexity for get and put operations
- Implemented using unordered_map and doubly linked list (STL list)
- Supports automatic eviction of least recently used elements
- Demonstrates real-world caching behavior used in systems and backend services

## Technologies Used
- C++
- STL (unordered_map, list)
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Data Structures & Algorithms

## How to Run
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o lru
./lru
